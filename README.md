# Quantum ARP Guard

## Overview

Quantum ARP Guard is an advanced ARP spoof detection system designed to address network vulnerabilities and secure communication using quantum cryptography. This tool provides real-time detection of ARP spoofing attacks and integrates the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol for enhanced security.

## Features

- **Real-time Detection**: Monitors and identifies ARP spoofing attacks as they occur.
- **Quantum Security**: Utilizes the BB84 protocol to ensure secure communication channels.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Generates detailed logs and graphical representations of network activity.

## Project Structure

- `Quantum ARP Guard.py`: Contains the GUI implementation using Tkinter.
- `main.py`: Core script responsible for ARP spoof detection and quantum key distribution.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SriShashank/Quantum-ARP-Guard.git
   cd Quantum-ARP-Guard
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python installed. Then, install the required Python libraries:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   
## Usage
1.**Run the Application**: Execute the GUI script to start the application:
  python "Quantum ARP Guard.py"
2. **Start Detection**:
  Click the "Start" button to initiate ARP spoof detection.
3. The application will monitor network traffic and alert you to any detected spoofing attempts.
  **View Logs and Graphs**:
  Click on "Logs" to view detailed records of detected attacks.
  Click on "Graph" to see a visual representation of network activity.
